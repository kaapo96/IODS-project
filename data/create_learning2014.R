# Description: Pre-processing of a data set 'learning2014'

# loading the data

# dim(learning2014) prints out the dimensions of the data, which are 183 observations and 60 variables
dim(learning2014)

# str(learning2014) prints out the structure of the data, i.e. all the variables, their types and first observations
str(learning2014)

# create column 'attitude' by scaling the column "Attitude"
